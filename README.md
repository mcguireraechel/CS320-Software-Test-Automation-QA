How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?

To ensure that a code, program or software is functional and secure testing should be done to find possible defects. In this project i employed the white box testing technique , unit testing. Unit testing allows a tester to test each individual part or function in a program to ensure its bug free, producing outputs that align with the expected outputs. 

User needs can be incorperated into a program by turning those needs into logical requirements, then taking those requirements and creating a program that meets those requirements. Requirements should be detailed enough so that a program can be created from it. An example could be if a user needs to have a password, we can create a requirement out of that but need to get more specifics, how many characters should the password be? should there be any special characters or upper case letters? Gathering these details help build requirements that can be programmed, so we can create a password that only works if the requirements are met.

Designing software begins with the requirements, after analyzing requirements theres many ways to move forward dependent on the complexity. If the requirement is more complex you may want to start with pseudocode or UML diagrams which can jot down the logic and give visual representations prior to coding. For this specific program i followed the "code a little, test a little" motto. Each function or object i created was tested before moving on so that i could assure it was bug free prior to programming more. This saves time in the end so that i dont have to go back later and change a whole program for an early mistake. Additionally, some parts of the program depended on the correct functionality of others, so if i programmed the whole thing before testing, i could protentially have many errors to go fix later on.
